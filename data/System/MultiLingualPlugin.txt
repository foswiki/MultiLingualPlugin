%TOC%

This plugin enables you to create wiki content in multiple languages. While Foswiki normally supports over 20 languages to internationalize its _user interface_,
content is _not_ translated in general. All of the standard documentation for Foswiki is shipped in English out of the box. Multi-lingual wikis go beyond pure
translation of the user interface. Their main purpose is to maintain the wiki _content_ in multiple languages presenting the matching translation according to
the user's language preferences. 

This plugin introduces a new macro =%TRANSLATE= which resembles very much the standard =%MAKETEXT= macro at first glance. However it adds a lot more flexibility
in maintaining translation the wiki way. While =%MAKETEXT= relies on =.po= translation files stored somewhere on your Foswiki installation on the file system, translations
for =%TRANSLATE= can be provided as wiki content itself, or inlined as part of the macro call itself. As a last resort will it reuse any translation available
in the system's =.po= lexicon.

---++ Usage

---+++ Specifying the target language
The target language to translate strings to can be specified in various ways:

   1 use the =language= parameter to =%TRANSLATE=,
   2 use the =CONTENT_LANGUAGE= preference variable or
   3 default to the user's language settings in the browser

... in the given priority order. Note that you might also use url parameters to configure the output of =%TRANSLATE= using this code:

<verbatim class="tml">
%TRANSLATE{"some source text" language="%URLPARAM{"content_language"}%"}%
</verbatim>

... or by specifying a wiki application to complute the =CONTENT_LANGUAGE= preference variable, e.g.

<verbatim class="tml">   * Set CONTENT_LANGUAGE = %URLPARAM{"content_language" default="en"}%</verbatim>

---+++ Inline translations

Translations can be specified inline:

<verbatim class="tml">
%TRANSLATE{
  "This here is not a pipe" 
  de="Das hier is keine Pfeife" 
  fr="Ceci n'est pas une pipe"
}%
</verbatim>

The macro will return the string matching the selected target language. Note that you might also make use of =%INCLUDE= to
switch to different content maintained somewhere else in your wiki:

<verbatim class="tml">
%TRANSLATE{
  "$percntINCLUDE{"DefaultText"}$percnt"
  de="$percntINCLUDE{"GermanText"}$percnt"
  en="$percntINCLUDE{"EnglishText"}$percnt"
  fr="$percntINCLUDE{"FrenchText"}$percnt"
}%
</verbatim>

---+++ Lexicon meta data

To separate the application of translated strings from their translation you might specify a lexicon, either

   * using the =lexicon= parameter to =%TRANSLATE= or
   * using the =CONTENT_LEXICON= preference variable

The lexicon is a topic holding =%META:LEXICON= records as produced by the Foswiki:Extensions/MetaDataPlugin
and specified in the [[LexiconForm]] shipped with this plugin.

---++ Syntax

---+++ TRANSLATE
This is the work horse returning a string based on the selected target language.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| ="string"= | (required) the source string to be translated; it serves as a lookup key into the lexicon | |
| =language="&lt;lang-code>"= | the language code of the target language | |
| =lexicon=="&lt;topic-name>"= | the topic holding the lexicon meta data | |
| =args="arg1, arg2, ..."= | arguments to be inserted into the translated string | |
| =splitargs="&lt;separator>"= | expression to separate items in the =args= list | =\s*,\s*= |

A =string= as well as a translation may contain placeholder such as =[_1]=, =[_2]=, =[_3]= ... to refer to the
first/second/third/... argument in the =args= list.

Example:

<verbatim class="tml">
%TRANSLATE{"Sorry, I haven't seen [_1] or [_2] recently." args="Dave, Audrey"}%
</verbatim>

Similarly, these tokens come in handy dealing with numbers in translations (see CPAN:Locale::Maketext):

Quantifying nounts:

<verbatim class="tml">
%TRANSLATE{"Your search matched [quant,_1,document,documents,no documents]" args="0"}%
%TRANSLATE{"Your search matched [quant,_1,document,documents,no documents]" args="1"}%
%TRANSLATE{"Your search matched [quant,_1,document,documents,no documents]" args="2"}%
</verbatim>

Format numbers according to this language's conventions.

<verbatim class="tml">
%TRANSLATE{"Sum taxes [numf,_1]" args="1234.56"}%
</verbatim>

Wrapper around Perl's normal =sprintf= function.

<verbatim class="tml">
%TRANSLATE{"Couldn't access datanode [sprintf,%f.2,_1]." args="12345"}%
</verbatim>

---+++ LANGUAGES
This overrides the standard =%LANGUAGES= macro shipped with Foswiki providing a much improved one.

It iterates over the list of given languages and returns information for each language found.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| ="&lt;lang1>, &lt;lang2>, ..."= | list of languages to render information for | languages enabled in Foswiki's =configure= |
| =header= | header string to be prepended to the output result; omitted when no language in the list was found | |
| =footer= | footer string to be appended to the output; omitted when no language was found | |
| =separator= | string separating items being formatted | =$n= |
| =format= | string to render information for each language found, see below for known format tokens | =$language= |
| =selection= | depicts a language in the list to be "selected" which activates the =$marker= string as defined below | |
| =marker= | string to be inserted into the =format= when the current language matches the =selection= | =selected="selected"= |
| =include= | regular expression a language must match for it to be included in the output | |
| =exclude | regular expression a language must _not_ match for it to be included in the output | |
| =sort= | 

Each language has got a list of properties that can be referred to in =format= and =sort=. 

   * language: the name of the language latin1 encoded, e.g. Bulgarian
   * name: the name of the language, locally encoded, e.g. Български
   * code: the language code, e.g. =bg=
   * label: the fully disambiguated name of this language, e.g. Chinese (Taiwan, Province of China)
   * icon: an image flag for this language, e.g. <img src="%PUBURLPATH%/System/MultiLingualPlugin/flags/16/Bulgaria.png" width="16" alt="Bulgarian" />
   * country: location where this language is spoken, e.g. Bulgaria

This information can be used as tokens in a =format= string, such as

   * =$language=
   * =$name= (or =$langname= ... provided for backwards compatibility)
   * =$code= (or =$langtag= ... provided for backwards compatibility)
   * =$label=
   * =$icon=, =$icon(&lt;size>)= (the html img with a country flag; use the second form to render a flag in different sizes)
   * =$country= 

In addition we have

   * =$marker= (see above for =selection= and =marker=)
   * =$index= running index of the language being processed
   * =$count= the total numbers of languages found

Standard escape tokens, i.e. =$n=, =$percnt= and =$dollar= are supported as well.

<div class="foswikiHelp">
%X% Caution: To display the localized language name correctly by using the =$name= format token your Foswiki's ={Site}{CharSet}= should be set to utf-8.
This is recommended for any new Foswiki installation. See Foswiki:Extensions/CharsetConvertorContrib. for a tool to convert existing content to utf-8.
</div>

---++ Examples

Render a full table of all known languages:

%LANGUAGES{
  header="| *#* | *Language* | *Name* | *Code* | *Country* | *Flag* |$n"
  format="| $index | $language | $name | $code | $country | $icon(32) |"
  separator="$n"
  footer="$n$n Found $count languages"
  sort="language"
}%
